Make sure that node-sass gets installed. I haven't put in the Media queries or anything for data this is just a rough draft. For some insight into what should be changed around. The colors and the images can be changed out for whatever we need. I just put blank divs where there should be content. I can adjust them so everything scales properly when we have content to add to them. I'll be working on other designs as well.
